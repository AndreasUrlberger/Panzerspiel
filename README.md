# Panzerspiel

Inspired by the game Wii Tanks, in this game the player controls a toy tank and fights others. Each tank has special features that differentiate it from others. The main challange of this game is that bullets ricochet at wall. One of the challanges in development is the calculation of bullet trajectories for the AI. The game is playable but development is currently on hold.

Developed with Unreal Engine 4
